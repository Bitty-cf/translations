# Translating Bitty's Website
Translate Bitty's services to your own language to make your, and other's experiences better.

## How do I start translating?
Edit the `en.json` and translate the values in it, <br>
after that rename it to the translated [country iso code](https://countrycode.org/). (Example: en.json, de.json, cn.json)

### After translating
After you made a pull request expect max `1 week` (because I'm busy recently) for response. <br>
After that you will be in the [Contributors](https://github.com/Bitty-cf/Translations/graphs/contributors) list.

## Thanks
Thanks for helping in Bitty's development. <br>
